**Data Structure Library**
=====================================

**Overview**
----------

This is a C program that implements various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees. The program allows users to select the data structure they want to work with and perform various operations on it.

**Features**
---------

* Arrays: Users can create and manipulate arrays of up to 100 elements.
* Linked Lists: Users can create and manipulate linked lists, and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
* Stacks: Users can create and manipulate stacks, and perform operations such as push, pop, and traversal.
* Queues: Users can create and manipulate queues, and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
* Binary Search Trees: Users can create and manipulate binary search trees, and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**Usage**
-----

### Running the Program
--------------------

Compile the program using `gcc` or your preferred compiler, and run it using the executable file.

### Menu Options
----------------

The program presents a menu with the following options:

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Binary Search Tree

### Selecting a Data Structure
---------------------------

Select the data structure you want to work with by entering the corresponding number.

### Performing Operations
-------------------------

Once you have selected a data structure, you can perform various operations on it. For example:

* For arrays, you can create an array of up to 100 elements and print its contents.
* For linked lists, you can create a linked list and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
* For stacks, you can create a stack and perform operations such as push, pop, and traversal.
* For queues, you can create a queue and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
* For binary search trees, you can create a binary search tree and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Exiting the Program
---------------------

To exit the program, select the "Exit" option from the menu.

**Limitations**
-------------

* The program has a maximum capacity of 100 elements for arrays.
* The program has a maximum capacity of 100 elements for linked lists.
* The program has a maximum capacity of 100 elements for stacks.
* The program has a maximum capacity of 100 elements for queues.
* The program has a maximum capacity of 100 elements for binary search trees.
